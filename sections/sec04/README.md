# Section 4

You can find the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LCV2fwk8&feature=youtu.be).

In this section, we first went over a few more peculiarities of Patina. Then, we built a lexer and a parser for a toy programming language for stack machines. We also covered debugging strategies which you might find helpful when writing your own lexer/parser for Patina.

This directory contains the code for the lexer/parser which we wrote during the section. You can run the driver with

    dune exec ./stack.exe -- <file>
