## Contents of this directory
- Notebooks
  - [without](section-02-no-solution.ipynb) solutions to exercises
  - [with](./section-02.ipynb) solutions (this notebook contains a lot more explanation)
  - You will need to install an [OCaml kernel for Jupyter](https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter) in order to run the notebook on your machine. But you don’t have to, as I’ve also included an [OCaml source file](section-02.ml), which contains all code snippets from the notebook and can be executed with any OCaml interpreter, such as `ocaml` or `utop`.
- [PDF](section-02.pdf) and the [OCaml program](section-02.ml) exported from the notebook with solutions
