# CS160 Compilers

The goal of this course is to give an introduction to compiler, a computer program that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language to create an executable program.
Through this course, you will learn to build a compiler from scratch.

The workloads include 5 programming assignments and a take-home midterm exam.
