# CS160 Compilers

The goal of this course is to give an introduction to compiler, a computer program that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language to create an executable program.
Through this course, you will learn to build a compiler from scratch.

The workloads include 5 programming assignments and a take-home midterm exam.

# Useful resources

You will find the [Patina materials](https://junrui-liu.github.io/patina) very helpful during
this course.

Textbook (Optional): Cooper, Keith, and Linda Torczon. Engineering a compiler.

These resources are helpful for learning OCaml:

1. [OCaml From the Ground Up](https://ocamlbook.org/): this is a good
   step-by-step introduction to OCaml.
2. [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/guided-tour.html): a
   comprehensive guide on OCaml: how to use it, the ecosystem and tooling, and
   common libraries.
3. [The OCaml system](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.11/htmlman/index.html): the
   official user manual for OCaml. Part I is helpful for seeing examples of what
   OCaml has to offer. You may also want to look at Part III, Chapter 17 for
   information on how to use the debugger.
4. [OCaml official documentation](https://ocaml.org/learn/)
5. [Learning OCaml in Y mins](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ocaml/)


# Academic Integrity
- Cheating WILL be taken seriously. It is not fair toward honest students to take cheating lightly, nor is it fair to the cheater to let him/her go on thinking that cheating is a reasonable alternative in life.
- The following is not considered cheating:
   - discussing broad ideas about programming assignments in groups, without being at a computer (with code-writing and debugging done individually, later).
- The following is considered cheating:
   - discussing programming assignments with someone who has already completed the problem, or looking at their completed solution.
   - looking at anyone else’s solution
   - Previous versions of the class.
   - leaving your code (for example in an online repository) visible to others, leading others to look at your solution.
   - receiving, providing, or soliciting assistance from unauthorized sources during a test.
- Programming assignments are not intended to be grade-makers, but to prepare you for the tests, which are the grade-makers. Cheating on the programming assignment is not only unethical, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of these assignments.
- Penalties: First time: a zero for the assignment; Second time: an “F” in the course.
